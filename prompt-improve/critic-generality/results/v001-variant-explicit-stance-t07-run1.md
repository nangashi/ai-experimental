### Generality Critique Results

#### Critical Issues (Perspective overly dependent on specific domains)
None (but see nuanced analysis below regarding the mix of generic, conditionally generic, and domain-specific items)

#### Scope Item Generality Evaluation
| Scope Item | Classification | Reason | Improvement Proposal |
|------------|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| トランザクション境界の明確化 | Generic | ACID transaction principles (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) are fundamental concepts applicable across diverse data storage systems. Testing across 3 contexts: financial system with relational database (meaningful—transaction boundaries for payment operations), NoSQL-based social media platform (meaningful—transaction semantics for post creation/updates), file-based configuration management (meaningful—atomic file updates). While "transaction" terminology originates from databases, the underlying concept of atomic operations applies broadly: database transactions, file system operations, distributed consensus, message queue processing. | None required. The ACID reference is to a fundamental computer science concept, not a specific technology. |
| 外部キー制約の設計 | Conditionally Generic | Foreign key constraints are a feature of relational databases (RDBMS). Testing across 3 contexts: PostgreSQL-based system (meaningful—referential integrity enforcement), MongoDB-based system (not meaningful—no foreign keys, application-level integrity), graph database (not meaningful—different integrity model). This is technology-dependent but not domain-dependent. Applicable to systems using relational databases, which represent a large subset of data-driven applications, but not universal. | Reclassify as "Conditionally Generic" with prerequisite: "リレーショナルデータベースを使用するシステムに適用" (applies to systems using relational databases). Alternative for broader applicability: generalize to "参照整合性の設計 - データ間の参照関係の整合性を保証する仕組み（外部キー制約、アプリケーションレベル検証、整合性チェック等）が設計されているか。" This broadens to include application-level referential integrity for non-RDBMS systems. |
| 楽観的ロック vs 悲観的ロック | Generic | Optimistic locking (version numbers, timestamps) and pessimistic locking are concurrency control strategies applicable across storage systems. Testing across 3 contexts: RDBMS with concurrent updates (meaningful—classic use case), NoSQL document store with version fields (meaningful—optimistic concurrency), distributed cache with compare-and-swap (meaningful—atomic operations). The underlying concept of concurrent update conflict resolution is universal across systems handling mutable shared state. Technology and domain agnostic. | None required. This is a fundamental concurrency control concept, not database-specific despite the terminology. |
| SOX法対応の変更履歴管理 | Domain-Specific | SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) is a U.S. financial regulation specific to publicly traded companies and their financial systems. Testing across 3 contexts: public company financial reporting system (meaningful), startup SaaS product (not meaningful—no SOX compliance requirement), open-source project (not meaningful). Fails "7 out of 10 projects" test. While audit trails are broadly valuable, the SOX-specific framing limits applicability to financial/compliance contexts. | Replace with "変更履歴管理（監査証跡）の設計 - 重要なデータ変更の履歴（変更者、変更時刻、変更内容、変更理由）を記録する仕組みが設計されているか。" Remove SOX reference entirely. This generalizes to audit logging for critical data, applicable across industries (healthcare audit trails, security incident investigation, debugging, compliance-agnostic change tracking). |
| 最終的整合性の許容範囲 | Conditionally Generic | Eventual consistency is a concept specific to distributed systems (microservices, distributed databases, message-driven architectures). Testing across 3 contexts: microservices architecture with event sourcing (meaningful—consistency trade-offs), monolithic application with single database (not meaningful—strong consistency by default), distributed cache synchronization (meaningful—cache invalidation delays). Applicable to distributed systems but not to monolithic or single-node architectures. | Add prerequisite: "分散システムに適用" (applies to distributed systems). Clarify that this item is relevant to microservices, distributed databases, event-driven architectures, but not to monolithic systems with centralized data stores. This is technology-architecture-dependent but not domain-dependent. |

#### Problem Bank Generality Evaluation
- Generic: 2 items
- Conditionally Generic: 1 item
- Domain-Specific: 2 items (list specifically: "外部キー制約が未設定で孤立レコードが発生" (RDBMS-specific), "変更履歴が記録されず監査不可" (implies SOX/compliance context from scope item 4))

Problem bank analysis:
1. "トランザクション境界が曖昧で部分的更新が発生する" - Generic. Partial update issues apply across RDBMS transactions, NoSQL operations, file updates, distributed operations. Testing across 3 contexts: banking system (meaningful), content management (meaningful), data pipeline (meaningful).
2. "外部キー制約が未設定で孤立レコードが発生" - Conditionally Generic. "外部キー制約" (foreign key constraints) explicitly references RDBMS. "孤立レコード" (orphaned records) is a referential integrity issue applicable to any system with relationships, but the foreign key framing is RDBMS-specific. Generalization: "参照整合性が保証されず孤立レコードが発生" (Referential integrity not guaranteed, orphaned records occur).
3. "並行更新時に後勝ち（last-write-wins）でデータ消失" - Generic. LWW conflict resolution issue applies to any system with concurrent updates: RDBMS, NoSQL, distributed caches, collaborative editing, distributed state. Testing across 3 contexts: e-commerce inventory (meaningful), collaborative document editing (meaningful), user profile updates (meaningful).
4. "変更履歴が記録されず監査不可" - Domain-Specific (context-dependent). In isolation, "変更履歴が記録されず" (change history not recorded) is generic. However, "監査不可" (cannot audit) is influenced by scope item 4's SOX compliance framing, suggesting a compliance/regulatory context. Generalization: "変更履歴が記録されずトラブルシューティングや調査が困難" (Change history not recorded, making troubleshooting and investigation difficult) removes compliance bias.
5. "分散システムでデータ不整合が長時間継続" - Conditionally Generic. Explicitly states "分散システム" (distributed system), making it conditionally applicable. Testing across 3 contexts: microservices (meaningful), monolithic system (not meaningful—no distribution), distributed database (meaningful).

#### Improvement Proposals
- **Scope Item 2 - Generalize or Add Prerequisite**: Either (a) add prerequisite "リレーショナルデータベースを使用するシステムに適用" for narrow scope, or (b) generalize to "参照整合性の保証設計" to include application-level referential integrity checks applicable to NoSQL, graph databases, and other non-RDBMS systems.
- **Scope Item 4 - Remove SOX Reference**: Replace "SOX法対応の変更履歴管理" with "データ変更履歴の管理" or "監査証跡の設計". The underlying audit trail concept is universally valuable (security investigations, debugging, compliance-agnostic change tracking, operational transparency) without the financial compliance framing.
- **Scope Item 5 - Add Prerequisite**: Insert note "(分散システムに適用)" to clarify this item is relevant only to distributed architectures. For monolithic systems, this item can be skipped or marked N/A.
- **Problem Bank Item 2 - Generalize**: Replace "外部キー制約が未設定で孤立レコードが発生" with "参照整合性が保証されず孤立データが発生" to apply to RDBMS foreign keys, NoSQL application-level validation, graph relationship integrity, etc.
- **Problem Bank Item 4 - Neutralize Compliance Bias**: Replace "監査不可" with more generic consequences: "変更履歴が記録されずデバッグや調査が困難" or "変更履歴が記録されず問題の原因特定が不可能".
- **Overall Judgment**: Since only 1 out of 5 scope items is clearly domain-specific (SOX法), the perspective does not require complete redesign. Recommend:
  1. Modify scope item 4 to remove SOX dependency (mandatory)
  2. Clarify prerequisites for items 2 and 5 (conditionally generic items)
  3. Generalize problem bank items 2 and 4 for broader applicability

#### Confirmation (Positive Aspects)
- **Strong generic foundation**: Items 1 (ACID transactions) and 3 (concurrency control) are fundamental computer science concepts with universal applicability across data systems, not tied to specific technologies, industries, or domains.
- **Appropriate use of technical terminology**: "ACID", "optimistic/pessimistic locking", "eventual consistency" are well-established technical terms in distributed systems and database literature. Using standard terminology is acceptable (unlike proprietary tool names).
- **Valuable mixed-mode perspective**: The combination of universal concepts (transactions, concurrency), technology-conditional concepts (foreign keys for RDBMS, eventual consistency for distributed systems), and one fixable domain-specific item (SOX) demonstrates real-world complexity. Once SOX is removed and prerequisites are clarified, this provides nuanced evaluation.
- **Problem bank mostly generic**: 2 out of 5 problems are fully generic (partial updates, LWW data loss), applicable across diverse systems. With minor generalization of items 2 and 4, the problem bank would be broadly applicable.
- **Addresses critical correctness concerns**: Data consistency and integrity are fundamental requirements across all data-driven systems—financial platforms, healthcare records, e-commerce catalogs, social media content, IoT telemetry. The perspective focuses on high-value design concerns.
- **Technology-aware without being prescriptive**: The perspective acknowledges technology realities (RDBMS have foreign keys, distributed systems have eventual consistency) without mandating specific technologies. It evaluates whether designers have considered consistency concerns appropriate to their architectural choices.
- **Clear path to full generality**: Unlike perspectives with deep structural issues (e.g., T05's pervasive tool dependencies), this perspective requires only one scope item modification (SOX removal) and two prerequisite clarifications to achieve strong generality.
- **Nuanced classification demonstrates sophisticated analysis**: The mix of Generic (2), Conditionally Generic (2), and Domain-Specific (1) items, with clear reasoning for each classification, shows this is a realistic, complex perspective that benefits from targeted refinement rather than wholesale rejection.
