### Generality Critique Results

#### Critical Issues (Perspective overly dependent on specific domains)
None

#### Scope Item Generality Evaluation
| Scope Item | Classification | Reason | Improvement Proposal |
|------------|----------------|--------|---------------------|
| 多要素認証(MFA)の実装 | Conditionally Generic | MFA is a widely applicable authentication strengthening technique recognized across industries (finance, healthcare, government, SaaS). However, it assumes user authentication exists. Testing across 3 contexts: web application with user login (meaningful), embedded firmware without user accounts (not meaningful—no authentication layer), batch processing system (not meaningful—no interactive users). Applicable to 7+ out of 10 projects when considering systems with user authentication. Not applicable to libraries/SDKs, data pipelines, embedded systems without users. | Add prerequisite clarification: "ユーザー認証機能を持つシステムに適用" (applies to systems with user authentication functionality). This is acceptable as conditionally generic with clear boundary conditions. |
| OAuth 2.0 / OIDC 対応 | Conditionally Generic | OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are open industry-standard protocols, not proprietary tools. They are widely adopted across industries and technology stacks. However, they assume: (1) user authentication exists, (2) integration with external identity providers is relevant. Testing across 3 contexts: SaaS application with Google/Microsoft SSO (meaningful), mobile app with social login (meaningful), internal tool with LDAP-only authentication (not meaningful—no external IdP). Applicable to many modern web/mobile applications but not all authentication scenarios. | Add prerequisite: "外部IdP連携を検討するシステムに適用" (applies to systems considering external identity provider integration). Note: OAuth/OIDC are standards, not vendor-specific, so mentioning them is acceptable unlike proprietary tools (Auth0, Okta). |
| セッション管理の安全性 | Conditionally Generic | Session management (timeout, token rotation, secure cookies) is a standard security practice for stateful authentication. Testing across 3 contexts: web application with sessions (meaningful), mobile app with JWT tokens (meaningful), stateless API service with per-request auth (partially meaningful—token rotation applies but not session timeout), embedded system (not meaningful—no sessions). Applicable to most user-facing applications with authentication. | Add prerequisite: "セッションまたはトークンベースの認証を持つシステムに適用" (applies to systems with session-based or token-based authentication). Broadly applicable to web and mobile applications. |
| パスワードポリシー | Conditionally Generic | Password strength requirements (length, complexity, history) are relevant to password-based authentication systems. Testing across 3 contexts: traditional web app with username/password (meaningful), enterprise system with password authentication (meaningful), modern SaaS with passwordless WebAuthn (not meaningful—no passwords), biometric-only mobile app (not meaningful). Many modern systems are moving toward passwordless authentication, making this conditionally applicable. | Add prerequisite: "パスワードベースの認証を実装するシステムに適用" (applies to systems implementing password-based authentication). Note the trend toward passwordless authentication means this may not apply to all modern authentication systems. |
| 権限の粒度設計 | Conditionally Generic | RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) are fundamental authorization models. However, assumes the system has authorization requirements. Testing across 3 contexts: enterprise SaaS with multi-tenant roles (meaningful), content management system with author/editor/admin roles (meaningful), public read-only website (not meaningful—no authorization), single-user desktop tool (not meaningful—no multi-user authorization). Applicable to most multi-user systems. | Add prerequisite: "複数ユーザーまたはロールを持ち、異なるアクセス権限が必要なシステムに適用" (applies to systems with multiple users/roles requiring different access permissions). Very broadly applicable to business applications, SaaS platforms, APIs with user context. |

#### Problem Bank Generality Evaluation
- Generic: 0 items
- Conditionally Generic: 4 items (all 4 examples assume user authentication exists but are otherwise technology-neutral)
- Domain-Specific: 0 items

All 4 problem bank entries assume authentication/authorization functionality but are otherwise generic and technology-neutral:
1. "MFAが未実装" - Testing across 3 contexts: banking application (meaningful—security gap), social media platform (meaningful—account protection issue), data processing pipeline (not meaningful—no user authentication). Applies to authentication systems across industries (finance, healthcare, e-commerce, SaaS).
2. "セッションタイムアウトが無制限" - Assumes session-based authentication. Applicable to web applications, mobile apps with sessions, APIs with stateful authentication. Industry-agnostic security anti-pattern.
3. "パスワードが平文で保存されている" - Critical security vulnerability applicable to any password-based system across industries. Technology-neutral (applies regardless of database, framework, or language).
4. "全ユーザーに管理者権限が付与されている" - Assumes multi-user authorization. Privilege escalation risk applicable to enterprise systems, SaaS platforms, content management, internal tools. Industry-agnostic.

#### Improvement Proposals
- **Add prerequisite statement to perspective introduction**: Insert at the beginning: "**適用対象**: この観点は、ユーザー認証・認可機能を持つシステムを対象とします。以下のようなシステムには適用されません: (1) ユーザーアカウント機能を持たない組込みファームウェア、(2) 認証レイヤーを持たないバッチ処理システム、(3) ライブラリ/SDK（認証は利用側アプリケーションの責務）、(4) ユーザーコンテキストを持たないデータ処理パイプライン。" (Target scope: This perspective applies to systems with user authentication and authorization. Not applicable to: embedded firmware without user accounts, batch systems without authentication layer, libraries/SDKs, data pipelines without user context.)
- **Add applicability notes to specific items**:
  - Item 2 (OAuth/OIDC): Add note "(外部IdP連携が不要な内部システムでは適用外)" (Not applicable to internal systems not requiring external IdP integration).
  - Item 4 (Password policy): Add note "(パスワードレス認証を採用する場合は適用外)" (Not applicable when passwordless authentication is adopted).
- **No item deletion or major revision needed**: All 5 items are appropriately scoped for authentication/authorization design review. The conditional applicability is reasonable and manageable with clear prerequisite documentation.
- **Maintain OAuth/OIDC references**: Unlike proprietary tool names (Auth0, Okta, AWS Cognito), OAuth 2.0 and OIDC are open standards widely adopted across industries and platforms. Mentioning standards is acceptable in a way that mentioning proprietary products is not.

#### Confirmation (Positive Aspects)
- **Appropriate use of industry standards**: OAuth 2.0 and OIDC are open, vendor-neutral protocols, not proprietary tools. This demonstrates the correct distinction between mentioning standards (acceptable) vs. specific products (problematic). Compare to T05's AWS CloudWatch (vendor-specific) or Prometheus (specific implementation)—this perspective correctly references protocols, not implementations.
- **Technology stack independence**: No dependency on specific authentication frameworks (Spring Security, Passport.js), cloud providers (AWS Cognito, Azure AD B2C), or programming languages. The concepts (MFA, session management, RBAC) are implementation-agnostic.
- **Industry independence**: Authentication and authorization concerns are equally relevant across finance, healthcare, e-commerce, SaaS, government, internal enterprise tools. No regulatory or domain-specific assumptions.
- **Universally recognized security concepts**: MFA, session timeout, password hashing, least privilege (RBAC/ABAC) are fundamental security principles taught in security courses and recognized across the software industry.
- **Problem bank quality**: All 4 problem examples represent common authentication/authorization security anti-patterns (missing MFA, unlimited sessions, plaintext passwords, excessive privileges) applicable across industries and project types.
- **Clear conditional boundary**: The prerequisite (user authentication functionality) is a clean, understandable boundary. This is a natural subset of software systems, not an arbitrary domain restriction. Authentication systems represent a significant majority of user-facing applications.
- **High applicability within scope**: For projects with user authentication (estimated 7-9 out of 10 user-facing applications), this perspective would provide meaningful evaluation results across web apps, mobile apps, APIs, SaaS platforms, enterprise systems, internal tools.
- **Appropriate abstraction level**: The perspective focuses on design concerns (whether MFA is considered, whether session timeout is defined, whether RBAC is designed) rather than implementation specifics (which MFA provider, exact timeout value, RBAC implementation library).
- **Balance between specificity and generality**: The perspective is specific enough to be actionable (concrete security concerns) yet general enough to apply broadly (not tied to industries, regulations, or tech stacks). This is the right balance for a design review perspective.
- **Trend awareness**: Item 4's password policy acknowledges the shift toward passwordless authentication by being conditionally applicable, showing awareness of evolving authentication patterns.
