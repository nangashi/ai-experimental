INIT state complete. Workspace initialized with 5 agents:

1. **consistency-design-reviewer** 
2. **performance-design-reviewer**
3. **reliability-design-reviewer**
4. **security-design-reviewer**
5. **structural-quality-design-reviewer**

Each agent has a working copy and baseline copy in `.task/infinite_update_agent_audit2/agents/`, plus per-agent directories with `test-docs/` subdirectories.

State transitioned to **SELECT_AGENT**. The next invocation will select the first agent (consistency-design-reviewer) for baseline evaluation.

Iteration 1 complete. Here's the summary:

**Iteration 1: consistency-design-reviewer**

| Metric | Baseline | Post-Improvement | Change |
|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| **Score** | 10.75 | 12.0 | **+1.25** |
| **SD** | 1.06 (low stability) | 0.0 (high stability) | Dramatically improved |
| **Verdict** | — | **EFFECTIVE** | — |

**Improvements applied:**
1. **IMP-01**: Added explicit out-of-scope section with boundary cases (scope clarity)
2. **IMP-02**: Consolidated ~15 scattered adversarial instructions into single bounded post-check (~60 lines removed)
3. **IMP-03**: Deleted vague Detection Strategy 4, converted Phase 1 to internal reasoning

State is now `SELECT_AGENT` (iteration 2). The next invocation will pick `performance-design-reviewer` (index 1) and begin its baseline evaluation.

Iteration 2 complete. Here's a summary:

**Iteration 2 | performance-design-reviewer**

- **Baseline**: 11.0 (SD: 1.414, low stability) on logistics domain
- **Improvements applied**:
  1. Added explicit scope boundaries with performance-reliability interface guidance
  2. Constrained inference instruction (missing spec vs. speculated bottleneck)
  3. Qualified Architecture antipatterns with performance-specific qualifiers
- **Post-improvement**: 11.5 (SD: 0.0, high stability) on healthcare domain
- **Verdict**: **EFFECTIVE** (Δ+0.5, SD improvement from 1.414→0.0)

State transitioned to `SELECT_AGENT` for iteration 3. Next agent will be `reliability-design-reviewer` (index 2).

[2026-02-12T17:09:18+09:00] --- Starting iteration ---
Iteration 3 complete. Here's a summary:

**Iteration 3 | reliability-design-reviewer**
- **Baseline**: 11.5 (SD: 0.0, logistics domain) — strong starting point with high stability
- **Improvements applied**: 3 bundled changes (remove vague scale instruction, add out-of-scope section with inline checklist qualifiers, qualify omission detection)
- **Post-eval**: 10.5 (SD: 0.0, healthcare domain) — **Δ-1.0 pt, INEFFECTIVE**
- **Action taken**: Reverted to baseline

**Key learning**: Adding scope qualifiers directly inline to checklist items (e.g., annotating "Distributed tracing" with "(tracing architecture → structural-quality)") likely caused the agent to self-censor valid detections. The out-of-scope pattern that worked for consistency/performance agents needs to be applied differently for reliability — scope boundaries should stay in a separate section without modifying the checklist items themselves.

State transitioned to `SELECT_AGENT` for iteration 4 (next agent: security-design-reviewer at index 3).
